  <h3 id="American"><b>American Entrepreneur</b></h3>
  
  <p id="paragrapha">South African-born American entrepreneur<br>
	                 who co-founded the electronic-payment firm PayPal and<br>
					 formed SpaceX, maker of launch vehicles and spacecraft.<br>
					 He was also one of the first significant investors in,<br>
					 as well as chief executive officer of, the electric <br>
					 car manufacturer Tesla.</p>

	<p id="early">Musk was born to a South African father and a<br>
		          Canadian mother. He displayed an early talent<br>
				  for computers and entrepreneurship.At age 12<br>
				  he created a video game and sold it to a computer<br> 
				  magazine. In 1988, after obtaining a Canadian<br>
				  passport, Musk left South Africa because he was<br>
				  unwilling to support apartheid through compulsory<br>
				  military service and because he sought the greater<br>
				  economic opportunities available in the United States.</p>

	<img src="paypal.jpg" id="paypalimg">

	<p id="career">Musk attended Queen’s University in Kingston, Ontario, and in 1992 he transferred to<br>
		           the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, where he received bachelor’s degrees<br>
				   in physics and economics in 1997. He enrolled in graduate school in physics at Stanford<br>
				   University in California, but he left after only two days because he felt that the Internet<br>
				   had much more potential to change society than work in physics. In 1995 he founded Zip2,<br>
				   a company that provided maps and business directories to online newspapers. In 1999 Zip2<br>
				   was bought by the computer manufacturer Compaq for $307 million, and Musk then founded<br>
				   an online financial services company, X.com, which later became PayPal, which specialized<br>
				   in transferring money online. The online auction eBay bought PayPal in 2002 for $1.5 billion.</p>

	<p id="career2">Musk was long convinced that for life to survive, humanity has to become a multiplanet species. However,<br>
		            he was dissatisfied with the great expense of rocket launchers. In 2002 he founded Space Exploration<br>
					Technologies (SpaceX) to make more affordable rockets. Its first two rockets were the Falcon 1<br>
					(first launched in 2006) and the larger Falcon 9 (first launched in 2010), which were designed to cost<br>
					much less than competing rockets. A 3rd rocket, the Falcon Heavy (first launched in 2018), was designed<br>
					to carry 117,000 pounds (53,000 kg) to orbit, nearly twice as much as its largest competitor, the Boeing<br>
					Company’s Delta IV Heavy, for one-third the cost. SpaceX has announced the successor to the Falcon 9 and<br>
					the Falcon Heavy: the Super Heavy–Starship system. The Super Heavy first stage would be capable of<br>
					lifting 100,000 kg (220,000 pounds) to low Earth orbit. The payload would be the Starship, a spacecraft<br>
					designed for providing fast transportation between cities on Earth and building bases on the Moon and<br>
					Mars. SpaceX also developed the Dragon spacecraft, which carries supplies to the International Space<br>
					Station (ISS). Dragon can carry as many as seven astronauts, and it had a crewed flight carrying<br>
					astronauts Doug Hurley and Robert Behnken to the ISS in 2020. Musk sought to reduce the expense of<br>
					spaceflight by developing a fully reusable rocket that could lift off and return to the pad it launched<br>
					from. Beginning in 2012, SpaceX’s Grasshopper rocket made several short flights to test such technology.<br>
					In addition to being CEO of SpaceX, Musk was also chief designer in building the Falcon rockets, Dragon,<br>
					and Grasshopper.</p>

	<p id="career3">Musk had long been interested in the possibilities of electric cars, and in<br>
		            2004 he became one of the major funders of Tesla Motors (later renamed Tesla),<br>
					an electric car company founded by entrepreneurs Martin Eberhard and Marc<br>
					Tarpenning. In 2006 Tesla introduced its first car, the Roadster, which could<br>
					travel 245 miles (394 km) on a single charge. Unlike most previous electric<br>
					vehicles, which Musk thought were stodgy and uninteresting, it was a sports car<br>
					that could go from 0 to 60 miles (97 km) per hour in less than four seconds.<br>
					In 2010 the company’s initial public offering raised about $226 million. Two<br>
					yrs later Tesla introduced the Model S sedan, which was acclaimed by automotive<br>
					critics for its performance and design. The company won further praise for its<br>
					Model X luxury SUV, which went on the market in 2015. The Model 3, a<br>
					less-expensive vehicle, went into production in 2017.</p>
